This is a repository of some of my robotics based deep learning projects. 

Project 1 entails classic ML methods of solving a 2D maze - this boils down to simple regression and classification
Project 2 uses Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks to solve the same problem as Project 1
Project 3 contains an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) to learn forward dynamics of a two link robot
Project 4 improves on the MPC method by using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm and using it to create a policy for the same robot
Project 5 utilizes the open source RL library stable-baselines3 to learn with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the two link robot
